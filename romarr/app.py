"""Romarr's HTTP service and web UI.

Deliberately stdlib-only for the server itself: this runs in a 512MB LXC beside
a download client and a database, and an *arr that needs a web framework to
answer six routes is an *arr that is harder to install than the thing it
automates.

The API is shaped like the other *arr applications -- /api/v1/<noun>, with the
same nouns wherever the concept is the same -- so anything that already speaks
Radarr or Sonarr is not surprised here. Where a concept genuinely differs it is
renamed rather than faked: there is no Calendar, because a ROM has no air date,
and a Quality Profile ranks regions rather than bitrates.

Routes:
  GET  /                       the UI
  GET  /api/v1/game            the library, from RomM
  GET  /api/v1/wanted/missing  requested and not yet imported
  GET  /api/v1/queue           in flight
  GET  /api/v1/history         what happened
  GET  /api/v1/indexer         Prowlarr's indexers (read-only)
  GET  /api/v1/downloadclient  download clients and whether they answer
  GET  /api/v1/config          settings
  PUT  /api/v1/config          partial settings update
  GET  /api/v1/system/status   health of every dependency
  GET  /api/v1/system/counts   badge counts for the nav
  POST /api/v1/command         run a task
  GET  /api/v1/log             recent events
  POST /api/request            request one game
  POST /api/v1/webhook         accept a request event from a front-end
