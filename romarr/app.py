"""ROMarr's HTTP service and web UI.

Deliberately stdlib-only for the server itself: this runs in a 512MB LXC beside
a download client and a database, and an *arr that needs a web framework to
answer six routes is an *arr that is harder to install than the thing it
automates.

The API is shaped like the other *arr applications -- /api/v1/<noun>, with the
same nouns wherever the concept is the same -- so anything that already speaks
Radarr or Sonarr is not surprised here. Where a concept genuinely differs it is
renamed rather than faked: there is no Calendar, because a ROM has no air date,
and a Quality Profile ranks regions rather than bitrates.

Routes:
  GET  /                       the UI
  GET  /api/v1/game            the library, from RomM
  GET  /api/v1/wanted/missing  requested and not yet imported
  GET  /api/v1/queue           in flight
  GET  /api/v1/history         what happened
  GET  /api/v1/indexer         Prowlarr's indexers (read-only)
  GET  /api/v1/downloadclient  download clients and whether they answer
  GET  /api/v1/config          settings
  PUT  /api/v1/config          partial settings update
  GET  /api/v1/system/status   health of every dependency
  GET  /api/v1/system/counts   badge counts for the nav
  POST /api/v1/command         run a task
  GET  /api/v1/log             recent events
  POST /api/request            request one game
  POST /api/v1/webhook         accept a request event from a front-end

    Configurable per client because the clients are separate installs with
    separate category lists, and because somebody running two ROMarrs against
    one SABnzbd needs to tell their downloads apart.

    The category does not have to exist in the client beforehand. SABnzbd 5.0.4
    defines *, movies, tv, audio and software out of the box, and `romarr` is
    none of them -- but an undefined category is accepted, kept verbatim on the
    job, and still matched by the history and queue filters this service uses to
    notice a finished download. Verified against a real instance, because the
    alternative reading -- that SABnzbd silently reassigns the job to Default
    and the history filter then never matches -- would be a download that
    completes and is never imported, with nothing anywhere saying why.

    Defining it in SABnzbd is still worth doing if you want the download to land
    in a folder of its own or run a post-processing script. ROMarr does not need
    it either way: it takes the finished path from SABnzbd's own `storage`
    field rather than assuming where the category put it.
