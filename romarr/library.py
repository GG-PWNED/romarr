"""Getting a finished download into RomM's library.

RomM reads a directory tree: `<library>/<platform-slug>/<rom file>`. Nothing
more clever than that is required, which is why this module is small — but the
details it does handle are the ones that silently corrupt a library:

  * archives (game releases are usually zipped or 7z'd, not bare ROMs)
  * choosing the ROM among the readmes and box art
  * never overwriting an existing ROM without being told to
  * never writing outside the library root, even if an archive contains
    `../../etc/passwd` — a real and old attack against every extractor
