"""Platform knowledge: names, RomM folder slugs, and ROM file extensions.

Three separate things have to agree before a downloaded file can become a
playable entry in RomM:

  1. what a user (or GG Requestz) calls the platform      -- "SNES", "Super Nintendo"
  2. what RomM calls the library folder                    -- `snes`
  3. which file inside the download is actually the ROM    -- `.smc`, not `.nfo`

Getting (3) wrong is the most common failure: game torrents routinely ship
readmes, box art, and sometimes several regional dumps in one archive.
