"""Persistence.

The *arr applications all keep the same things across a restart: what you
asked for, what happened to it, and how you configured the thing. Romarr kept
all of it in memory, so a restart lost your history and your settings -- which
is the difference between a tool and a demo.

This is a JSON file with a lock rather than a database, and that is a
deliberate ceiling rather than an oversight: the entire working set is a few
thousand events, and an *arr that needs a database daemon to file ROMs is
harder to install than the thing it automates. If this ever outgrows a file,
the shape here (load / mutate / save under one lock) is the same shape SQLite
would want.

Writes are atomic -- written to a sibling temp file and renamed -- because the
alternative is that a crash mid-write leaves a truncated JSON file and the
service will not start again.
