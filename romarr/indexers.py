"""Prowlarr search, the way the *arrs do it.

Prowlarr aggregates every configured torrent and usenet indexer behind one
Torznab-ish API, which is why Romarr talks to it rather than to indexers
directly: adding a new tracker becomes a Prowlarr concern, not a Romarr one.

Two things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

  * Prowlarr's `downloadUrl`/`magnetUrl` are links back to Prowlarr itself with
    the API key in the query string. Handing one to a user, a log, or a public
    page leaks the key. Only a literal `magnet:` URI is safe to pass around; for
    anything else the grab has to go through Prowlarr server-side.
  * Category filtering must happen in the query, not after. Asking an indexer
    for "Mario" unfiltered returns films, and a scoring pass that has to reject
    them is doing work the indexer would have done for free.

    """The safest usable link for a Prowlarr result.

    Prowlarr's field names mislead. `magnetUrl` is frequently NOT a magnet: for
    several indexers it is a link back to Prowlarr carrying `?apikey=<key>` in
    the query string, while the real magnet sits in `guid`. Accepting `guid`
    only when it looked like an http URL therefore discarded a perfectly good
    magnet and reported the release as having no download link -- which is how
    every Pirate Bay and KickassTorrents result failed.

    Order is by safety first and then by what actually works:

      * A literal magnet carries no credential and needs no proxy.
      * `downloadUrl` is Prowlarr fetching the .torrent on our behalf. It
        embeds Prowlarr's API key, so it is fit to hand to a download client
        server-side and never to a browser or a log -- sanitise_for_display
        enforces that at the boundary.
      * A magnet rebuilt from `infoHash` comes last of the usable options,
        because it announces to the public trackers below and nothing else.
      * `guid` as an http URL is the final fallback. It is an identifier, not a
        download -- frequently a details page -- so it must never outrank a
        real `downloadUrl` or a rebuilt magnet.

    `private` suppresses the rebuild entirely. A private tracker's torrent
    disables DHT and PEX and announces only to the tracker itself carrying the
    account's passkey, so a magnet rebuilt with public announce URLs can never
    find a peer. Preferring that rebuild over Prowlarr's own download URL --
    which is what happened whenever a private result carried an infohash --
    turned a working grab into a torrent that sat at zero peers forever, after
    the release had been selected correctly. Returning nothing here instead is
    the honest outcome: it surfaces in History as "no usable download link"
    rather than as a download that never starts.
