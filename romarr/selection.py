"""Choosing which release to grab, and which file inside it is the ROM.

Both decisions are pure functions over metadata, so they are unit-testable
without a network, a download client, or a filesystem. That matters because
they are where this pipeline goes wrong in practice: grab the wrong release and
you download 40GB of a PC port instead of a 512KB cartridge; pick the wrong file

# A release title says what was DONE to a ROM at least as often as it says

# Chrono Trigger was answered with "[SNES] Chrono Trigger [RUS] [jRPG] [by
# Chief-NET] [1995]" -- a Russian fan translation. It is a genuine SNES
# cartridge dump of the right game, so every check above passes; it was simply
# the best-seeded of thirteen results and nothing in its title says "hack" or
# "translation" in so many words.
#
# Japanese is deliberately absent. "(J)" on a cartridge is a region, not a
# translation -- the game as published -- and the region ladder already ranks
# it below USA, World and Europe. Penalising it here would push a legitimate
# Japanese dump below a Russian fan patch, which is the same bug facing the
# other way.
