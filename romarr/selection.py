"""Choosing which release to grab, and which file inside it is the ROM.

Both decisions are pure functions over metadata, so they are unit-testable
without a network, a download client, or a filesystem. That matters because
they are where this pipeline goes wrong in practice: grab the wrong release and
you download 40GB of a PC port instead of a 512KB cartridge; pick the wrong file
and RomM imports a readme.
