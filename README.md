# Romarr

The *arr for games. Request a title, Romarr finds it, grabs it, and files it
into your game library.

**It is not tied to one library.** RomM, [Gaseous](https://github.com/gaseous-project/gaseous-server)
and [Retrom](https://github.com/jmberesford/retrom) are all supported, chosen
with a single setting:

    LIBRARY_KIND=romm      # or gaseous, or retrom
    LIBRARY_URL=http://your-library:8080
    LIBRARY_API_KEY=...    # or LIBRARY_USERNAME / LIBRARY_PASSWORD

Existing installs need no changes: `LIBRARY_KIND` defaults to `romm` and the
old `ROMM_*` variables are still read.

Adding a backend means implementing four methods -- reachable, count, games,
rescan -- in `romarr/libraries.py`. Nothing else in the service learns which
library is attached.


**The *arr for games.** Romarr watches for game requests, searches your
indexers through Prowlarr, hands the winner to your download client, and files
the ROM into [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) where it can actually be
played.

If you run Radarr for films and Sonarr for TV, this is the missing one.

## Why it exists

Radarr and Sonarr solved "request a thing, get the thing, filed correctly."
Nobody had done it for ROMs, and ROMs have their own problems that a film
downloader does not:

- **The wrong file is usually in the box.** Game releases ship readmes, box art,
  and often several regional dumps in one archive. Importing `readme.nfo` into
  your library helps nobody.
- **Size is a signal, not a preference.** A 40 GB "SNES" result is a romset, a
  PC port, or a bad match. For a cartridge, *smaller is usually more correct* —
  the opposite of video.
- **Platform names are ambiguous.** "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"
  contains "Nintendo Entertainment System". Naive matching sends every SNES
  request to the NES folder. (There is a test for this, because it happened.)

## What it does

- Searches **Prowlarr**, filtered to console and PC-game categories at the query
  rather than after, so films never enter the ranking in the first place
- **Scores releases** on seeders, region (USA → World → Europe → Japan), and
  size sanity, and rejects prototypes, hacks and demos
- Grabs via **qBittorrent** (torrent), **SABnzbd** or **NZBGet** (usenet),
  routing each release to a client that speaks its protocol
- **Picks the ROM** out of the finished download, preferring the platform's own
  extensions in order and the best regional dump when several are present
- **Imports into RomM** at `<library>/<platform-slug>/`, refusing to overwrite
  unless told
- Triggers a RomM rescan so the game appears without a manual refresh
- **Translates download paths** when the client runs elsewhere, the way Radarr
  and Sonarr's remote path mappings do — without it the import fails with
  "download path does not exist" while the file sits right there
- Keeps **History, Wanted and settings** across a restart
- A web UI shaped like the other *arrs: Library, Wanted, Activity, Settings,
  System

## Safety, deliberately

- **Zip-slip is blocked.** Archive entries that resolve outside the library root
  are dropped, not sanitised — a release that needs sanitising is not one to
  trust. Tested.
- **Prowlarr API keys never reach a browser or a log.** Prowlarr's
  `downloadUrl` is a link back to itself *with the key in the query string*.
  That URL is passed to the download client, which fetches it server-side —
  the same thing Radarr and Sonarr do, and the only way usenet can work at all,
  since an NZB has no magnet equivalent. It is redacted everywhere it could be
  displayed or logged. Tested.
- **Nothing overwrites silently.** An existing ROM is left alone and reported.

## Supported platforms

Cartridge-era systems, deliberately: NES, SNES, Game Boy / Color / Advance,
N64, Genesis / Mega Drive, Master System, Game Gear, Atari 2600 / 7800, Lynx,
TurboGrafx-16, WonderSwan, Neo Geo Pocket, Virtual Boy.

Disc-based platforms are excluded on purpose. Their images are gigabytes, often
multi-file, and cannot be streamed into a browser emulator — which is the point
of feeding RomM in the first place.

## Install

Proxmox LXC, one line:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlizzHacker/romarr/main/proxmox/ct/romarr.sh)"
```

Or run it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlizzHacker/romarr.git && cd romarr
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # then edit it
python -m romarr
```

## Configuration

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `PROWLARR_URL` / `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | your Prowlarr, for searching |
| `ROMM_URL` / `ROMM_USERNAME` / `ROMM_PASSWORD` | RomM, for the rescan trigger |
| `ROMM_LIBRARY` | path to RomM's library root, e.g. `/mnt/roms` |
| `QBITTORRENT_URL` / `QBITTORRENT_USER` / `QBITTORRENT_PASS` | torrent client |
| `SABNZBD_URL` / `SABNZBD_API_KEY` | usenet client, optional |
| `NZBGET_URL` / `NZBGET_USER` / `NZBGET_PASS` | usenet client, optional |
| `GGREQUESTZ_URL` | shows the request front-end's status, optional |
| `ROMARR_DATA` | where history and settings are kept |

A protocol with no client configured cannot be grabbed at all — results are
found, ranked, and then refused. The Download Clients page names any protocol
in that state rather than leaving you to work it out.

### Remote path mapping

If your download client runs in a different container or host, it reports paths
in *its* filesystem. Set the mapping under Settings → Media Management, or in
the settings file:

```json
"remote_path_mappings": [
  { "remote": "/downloads", "local": "/mnt/downloads" }
]
```

The longest matching prefix wins. A mapping cannot help if the volume is not
mounted here at all — that stays a mount problem, and you find out because the
translated path still does not exist.

Use a **dedicated RomM account**, not your admin one. Romarr needs only
enough to trigger a scan.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

The decisions that matter — which release to take, which file is the ROM, and
whether an archive entry is safe to extract — are pure functions with no
network, so they are tested directly rather than mocked around.
